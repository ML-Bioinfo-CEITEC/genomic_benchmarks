# Human non-TATA promoters

Human promoters as described in the paper [Recognition of prokaryotic and eukaryotic promoters using convolutional deep learning neural networks](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0171410#abstract0).

The data have been imported with `seq2loc` utility. Totally, 19657 out of 19811 promoters and 16474 out of 27731 sequences have been found in the human genome reference and included.
