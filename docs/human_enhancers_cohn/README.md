# Human Enhancers

Human enhancers as described in the paper [Enhancer Identification using Transfer and
Adversarial Deep Learning of DNA Sequences](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/02/14/264200.full.pdf).

The data have been imported with `seq2loc` utility. Totally, 13895 out of 14000 human enhancers and 13896 out of 140000 negative controls have been found in the human genome reference and included.
