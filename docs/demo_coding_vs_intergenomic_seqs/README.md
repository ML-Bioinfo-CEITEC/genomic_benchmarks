# Intergenomic vs Coding sequences from GRCh38

Demo dataset previously used at ECCB deep learning workshop: https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/ECCB2020/

Randomly generated 50,000 sequences from intergenomic regions and randomly generated 50,000 sequences from human transcripts, 200bp long, 75% used for training, 25% for testing.
