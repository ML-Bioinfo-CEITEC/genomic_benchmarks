# Drosophila enhancers vs Random background regions from dm6

Positive samples are Drosophila Enhancer regions from Stark Lab. These enhacers were experimentaly validated and we excluded the weak ones. Original coordinates refered to the dm3 assembly of the D. melanogaster genome. We used [pyliftover](https://github.com/konstantint/pyliftover) tool to map coordinates to the dm6 assembly.

Negative sequences are randomly generated from drosophila genome dm6 to match lengths of positive sequences and to not overlap them.
