# Human Open Chromatin regions vs Random background regions from GRCh38

Dataset created with data downloaded from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) release 100.

Positive sequences are Human Open Chromatin regions from The Ensembl Regulatory Build [Zerbino et al. 2015](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4407537).
Negative sequences are randomly generated from Human genome GRCh38 to match lengths of positive sequences and to not overlap them.

The Ensembl Regulatory Build contains a genome-wide set of regions that are likely to be involved in gene regulation. Process of creating it can be found at [The Ensembl Regulatory Build](http://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/funcgen/regulatory_build.html) page.
