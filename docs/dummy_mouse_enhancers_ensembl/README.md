# Mouse Enhancer regions vs Random background regions from GRCm38

Dataset created with data downloaded from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html) release 100.

Positive sequences are mouse Enhancers from [VISTA Enhancer Browser](https://enhancer.lbl.gov/), but accessed via Ensembl. 
Negative sequences are randomly generated from mouse genome GRCm38 to match lengths of positive sequences and to not overlap them.

The VISTA Enhancer Browser is a central resource for experimentally validated human and mouse noncoding fragments with gene enhancer activity as assessed in transgenic mice. Most of these noncoding elements were selected for testing based on their extreme conservation in other vertebrates or epigenomic evidence (ChIP-Seq) of putative enhancer marks.
