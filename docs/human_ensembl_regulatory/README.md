# Human regulatory regions

Dataset created with data downloaded from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html).

Sequences belong to three classes:
- Human **Enhancer regions** from The Ensembl Regulatory Build [Zerbino et al. 2015](https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4407537).
- Human **Open Chromatin regions** from The Ensembl Regulatory Build. Open chromatin regions (OCRs) are special regions of the genome that can be accessed by DNA regulatory elements. In The Ensembl Regulatory Build, this label is assigned to pen chromatin regions, which were experimentally observed through DNase-seq, but covered by none of the other annotations (enhancer, promoter, gene, TSS, CTCF, ...). 
- Human **Promoter regions** from The Ensembl Regulatory Build.

The Ensembl Regulatory Build contains a genome-wide set of regions that are likely to be involved in gene regulation. Regulatory features in The Ensembl Regulatory Build are identify as consensus of segments across multiple cell types. Process of creating it can be found at The Ensembl Regulatory Build page.
