# Human Enhancer regions vs Random background regions from GRCh38

Dataset created with data downloaded from [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html).

Positive sequences are Human enhancers from [The FANTOM5 project](https://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/), but accessed via Ensembl. 
Negative sequences are randomly generated from Human genome GRCh38 to match lengths of positive sequences and to not overlap them.

The FANTOM5 project contains atlases of mammalian promoters, enhancers, lncRNAs and miRNAs. They have mapped the sets of transcripts, transcription factors, promoters and enhancers active in the majority of mammalian primary cell types and a series of cancer cell lines, and tissues, using Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE).
